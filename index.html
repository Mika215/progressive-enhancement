<h1>The Story</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>
Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<br> <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <em><q>Maybe.</q></em> <br> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<em><q>Maybe.</q></em><br> 

The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q> Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <em><q>Maybe.</q></em> <br>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <em><q>Maybe.</q></em><br>
The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — <em>because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</em> </blockquote>

<p>Conclusion 
Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
