This is an individual coding challange given by the [Becode -Jepsen-5.34](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Jepsen-5.34/blob/master/01-the-field/04-html-css/01-fundamentals/06-exercise-progressive-enhancement.md).

The ultmate gole of this challange/mini-project is to practice and enhence the efective use of [`HTML semantics`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/semantic-html5-elements/).

You can refer what the final version of this project looks like by cliking the [Repo's page](https://mika215.github.io/progressive-enhancement/)

or you may like to clone the source code  -- just copy & paste the below stated comand in your `terminal` and then hit enter.

Any constructive comments and sugestions are welcome!

**Technologies used** 

I have used `HTML` to structure the content then `css` to give some basic style.
